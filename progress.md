# 📊 ERP Development Progress Report

## ✅ Completed Features
- Synced ERP Project Phase 2 with the main ERP development thread.
- Reviewed and summarized current progress from GitHub repo.

- Code structure: improve naming conventions, follow PSR-12 standards.
- Documentation: expand README.md and inline comments.
